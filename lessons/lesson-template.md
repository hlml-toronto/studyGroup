**Title:** *Lesson Title*

**Author:** *Your name and Study Group name here!*

**Level:** *Novice, intermediate, advanced. These categories are very general, but combined with the prerequisites below they should give a sense of the skill level involved, so users can decide if this lesson is right for them.*

**Prerequisites:** *What skills or knowledge you definitely need before you start-- for example, “be comfortable with functions, loops, and conditionals in R” or “ know basic Python.”*

**Tech or materials needed:** *list any special requirements, like specific software, a certain development environment, a certain library installed, a specific data set and format to work with, etc, etc*

**Summary/Context/Objectives:** *In this section, include WHAT this lesson will enable you to do, and WHY you might want to do that, what are some applications for this tool or skill.* 

**Tips:**
*This section should be written so that someone unfamiliar with the content can understand what the lesson is about, and if it will be useful to them. 
Include definitions of any really important, key words here in the summary. For example, don’t just say “this lesson will teach you to use pandas,” say “this lesson will teach you to use pandas, an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language”* 

**Steps to Complete:** *Break down and organize the lesson in numbered steps.*   

**Tips:** 
* Show expected output or results, whenever possible. 
* Include code samples
* Don’t just list a set of instructions, add a few words about what each step does and why.
* If you come to a point where things might get confusing, add a sentence or two to clarify.

**Glossary:** *list any new, potentially unfamiliar or confusing terms or jargon and define them here.*

**Additional Resources** *add links to other resources that might be helpful (demos, examples, tutorials, etc).*

**For Further Exploration:** *Add links to more advanced lessons or materials that build on this topic.*
