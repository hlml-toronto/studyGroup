### Subsections

If you'd like to reference your code on github (for example the Jupyter Notebook CODE.ipynb in your FOLDER), you can use
```html
<a href="{{ site.github }}/lessons/FOLDER/CODE.ipynb"><u>link</u></a>
```
Note that you want to leave the site.github business in. For example, you can find the Jupyter Notebook at this <a href="{{ site.github }}/lessons/template/example_notebook.ipynb"><u>link</u></a>. Or you can check out the whole folder at <a href="{{ site.github }}/lessons/template"><u>link</u></a>.
